NAME
    HTTP::Tiny - A tiny HTTP client

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use HTTP::Tiny;

        my $response = HTTP::Tiny->new->get('http://example.com/');

        print "$response->{status} $response->{reason}\n";

        while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$response->{headers}}) {
            for (ref $v eq 'ARRAY' ? @$v : $v) {
                print "$k: $_\n";
            }
        }

        print $response->{content} if defined $response->{content};

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed primarily for doing
    simple GET requests without the overhead of a large framework like
    LWP::UserAgent.

    It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports
    proxies (currently only non-authenticating ones) and redirection. It
    also correctly resumes after EINTR.

    Additional documentation and improved tests will be forthcoming.
